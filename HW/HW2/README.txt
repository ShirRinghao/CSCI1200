DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CREATIVE STATISTIC:
Please be concise!
My custom function finds the earliest class of the week by a custom sort function (first sort by day, then begin time, then room). And then finds out how many classes on each day from Monday to Friday.
It basically gives students an idea of how many classes a school offers every single day(If all classes are included in the input file).

Sample of the output after formatting:
The earlies class of the week is GENETICS_&_EVOLUTION on Monday at 10:00AM in room ACADMY_AUD.
There are 4 different classes on Monday.
There are 5 different classes on Tuesday.
There are 3 different classes on Wednesday.
There are 4 different classes on Thursday.
There are 4 different classes on Friday.

The earlies class of the week is RANDOMIZED_ALGORITHMS on Monday at 10:00AM in room DARRIN_239.
There are 1 different classes on Monday.
There are 0 different classes on Tuesday.
There are 0 different classes on Wednesday.
There are 1 different classes on Thursday.
